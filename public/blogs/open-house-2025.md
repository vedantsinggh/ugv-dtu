# Open House 2025 – Technology Showcase

## Overview

In **November 2025**, our college organized **Open House 2025**, an outreach event aimed at providing visiting **Class 12 students** with an opportunity to explore academic life, student-led projects, and hands-on engineering initiatives within the institution.

The event focused on introducing young learners to the **practical applications of science and technology**, while familiarizing them with the campus environment, laboratories, and student innovation culture.

As part of this event, our team showcased two major engineering projects:

- **Valkyrie Drone**
- **UGV Ashwini**

The Open House served as a platform to demonstrate **innovation, teamwork, and real-world engineering implementation** beyond classroom theory.

## Showcase of Valkyrie Drone

During the Open House, the team formally presented **Valkyrie**, an indigenously developed drone platform, to the visiting students. This marked the **first academic showcase** of the drone to an external audience.

The presentation covered:

- Airframe design  
- Propulsion system  
- Flight controller and onboard electronics  
- Sensors and communication systems  
- Supporting software architecture  

The explanation was delivered in a **structured and student-friendly manner**, emphasizing how fundamental concepts of **physics, electronics, and programming** combine to enable stable and controlled flight.

The team also discussed real-world applications of drones, including:

- Surveying and mapping  
- Infrastructure inspection  
- Exploration and research  
- Environmental monitoring  

These examples helped students relate the project to practical use cases.

## Showcase of UGV Ashwini (IGVC 2025)

Alongside the aerial platform, the team also showcased **UGV Ashwini**, an unmanned ground vehicle developed for autonomous navigation challenges.

UGV Ashwini represented the college at the **International Ground Vehicle Competition (IGVC) 2025**, held at **Oakland University, Rochester, Michigan, USA**.

The UGV was presented with a focus on its **autonomous capabilities**, including:

- Obstacle detection  
- Path planning and navigation  
- Decision-making without human intervention  

Students were introduced to the role of **sensors, control algorithms, and system integration** in enabling autonomous ground vehicles. Participation in an international competition highlighted the **scale, seriousness, and professionalism** of student-driven engineering projects.
